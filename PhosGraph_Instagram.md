We use a mixture of manual control and Python Selenium script, to extract data from Instagram pages, and save them to the PhosGraph database, as illustrated with the series of screenshots below.

After login to Instagram using a web browser, we navigate to a typical user page like the following, with screenshot as shown in figure 1:

- https://www.instagram.com/emmeline_glam/

We run the Python Selenium script as shown in figure 2 in interactive mode (`python3 -i`):

We have omitted other start up scripts in figure 2 for clarity. Additional explanation can be found ....

Figure 3 shows the PhosGraph page where the json data is entered, corresponding to lines 9 to 14 in figure 2.

Figure 4 shows the PhosGraph GET interface, where the database, essentially kept as a space delimited text file, can be accessed via Phoscript Reverse Polish Notation.
