I. Phosway: A Revolutionary Software Architecture
Phosway is a revolutionary, comprehensive suite of projects consisting of modules from ID-less payments, distributed cloud, to a lightweight but flexible Forth like programming framework. Phosway is designed to overcome the bottlenecks and limitations of today’s network computing infrastructure. It can be deployed in an incremental and non-disruptive manner, so that your existing infrastructure can be migrated seamlessly to a future-proof platform:

Phoscript is a Reverse Polish Notation, stack machine programming language, derived from the Forth programming language.
Phoshell is a stack machine shell employing Phoscript, implementable in ANY known programming language and framework.
PhosKey is an implementation of transient key cryptography using Phoshell.
PhosCloud is a distributed cloud system enabling users to host Phos applications (clients and servers) on personal mobile devices and home networks.
PhosPay is a payment system employing PhosKey, thus eliminating the need of usernames, which can then be an interface between existing payment systems.
PhosKnow is a knowledge sharing platform hosted on PhosCloud, allowing users to share knowledge and ideas, and get rewarded using PhosPay.

Phosway is designed to serve various target users, from ordinary users, programmers, trainers and trainees to investors.

Together, we can build a new kind of social network, PhosKnow where users not only share knowledge like Wikipedia, but earn monetary rewards via PhosPay online tipping. We may reward a user USD1 for a piece of knowledge he (she) shares. This has not been achieved due to the fragmentation of user base, caused by the conventional Unix style user authentication system, which is overcome using PhosKey.

Trainers and trainees, including programmers, can use PhosKnow to create online tutorials, where trainers can be paid using PhosPay on ad hoc basis, the preferred way by trainees in the hyper competitive social media era. Trainees can also be paid for helping trainers to work on revenue generating projects.

Online celebrities outside China can now enjoy online tipping thanks to PhosPay which overcomes the bottlenecks of incompatible payment systems using PhosKey, based on breakthroughs in transient key cryptography.

PhosPay can create communities of agents and investors, pooling funds with ID-less but transparent transactions, thus enabling novel forms of financial instruments, integrating conventional fiat currencies and novel cryptocurrencies.

Free software programmers can now build a distributed cloud computing system that is truly "owned by everyone", instead of being exploited by giant tech hegemons where free software programmers have no means of negotiating the fees to use their contributions, via PhosPay and PhosCloud.

PhosVR is the culmination of Dr. Ng Liang Shing's expertise in image processing, metaprogramming and ID-less transactions:
Imagine, instead of seeing half a dozen of your colleagues in six split screens, now they are seated in a virtual boardroom at a round table, in vivid 3D views.
Imagine an app that extracts the face or body of someone dancing, merging the dancing bodies of a dozen or several dozen other dancers at different locations, projected into an augmented reality, letting all participants to participate in an AR dance pool — much like a Zoom session, but in 3D AR.

Phosway can bring exceptional benefits to IT companies of ANY SIZE: 
i) Phosway enables old and new systems to be maintained or developed using ONE universal script language.
ii) Experienced developers (programmers) can easily adapt to new programming languages and platforms, thus reducing the costs of human resources turnover.
iii) Junior developers can acquire advanced programming skills quickly due to the simple syntax of RPN, while being able to interface to complex and advanced functionalities of the host programming language and platform.     

II. Next Generation Social Networks
As the world grapples with the threat of COVID19 pandemic, we must quickly adapt to new threats and challenges. Phosway forms the core of a new social network platform in this new era, with the following new social network apps, benefiting users primarily through online micropayments using PhosPay:
i) Home Cook Delivery: to streamline the production of prerecorded and live broadcast of cooking sessions; to retrain unemployed workforce as cooks, delivery and other related roles.
ii) Share & Give: to help small and medium businesses by advertising through giving away vouchers while sharing photos and videos of products and services.
iii) Gurunet: an online education and training platform based on Socratic teaching methods, to replace conventional schools and universities. 
iv) PhosMath: the Reverse Polish Notation used in Phoscript is also capable of representing and analyzing mathematical equations. As such, Phosway can literally create a revolution in the teaching and learning of programming and mathematics, benefiting 5 year olds to 75 year olds, expert programmers and non-programmers alike.
