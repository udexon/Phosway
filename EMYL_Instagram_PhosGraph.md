EMYL Instagram PhosGraph

We define Free Software Revolution 1.0 (FSR1) as the period encompassing the creation of GNU Linux and tools to Google's acquisition of the Android operating system. The mobile computing era, empowered by Android and iOS, saw the rise of tech giants and start-ups worth trillions of USD, as well as cryptocurrencies. 

We may say FSR1 is essentially CLONING the then proprietary Unix operating systems and tools.

Free Software Revolution 2.0 (FSR2) will then be the CLONING of MAGAF social networks, where MAGAF stands for Microsoft Apple Google Amazon Facebook. It is a pun to MAGA+F, everyone's favorite derogatory letter.

Cloning MAGAF is not rocket science. There are enough free software programmers to do so. However, they move like random air particles. We need SEVERAL BREAKTHROUGH MECHANISMS to make these most talented individuals on Earth to become "self organized". Phosway is the name of this comprehensive suite of projects. (Click [here](https://github.com/udexon/Phosway/blob/master/README.md) for details.)


## B. PhosGraph Instagram Examples

Let us illustrate the philosophy and benefits of EMYL using the following example:

The number of followers of an Instagram user is extracted and saved on a publicly accessible web server, PhosGraph.
Anyone may be able to query the PhosGraph server, as well as contribute code to enhance its functionalities.
Donors may pay contributors of PhosGraph using PhosPay, a novel ID-less online payment system system based on transient key cryptography.

https://github.com/udexon/Phosway/blob/master/PhosGraph_Instagram.md

The example given in the link above seems completely counterintuitive compared to the "mainstream" web programming solutions in recent years. i.e. One expects to see a node.js or yarn project with a beautiful front end and a sophisticated back end which consume no less than 500MB or disk space.

There are 2 primary reasons for this:

To demonstrate the features of  transient key cryptography graph database
Zero investment bootstrap

Transient key cryptography has gained some exposure indirectly in recent years due to the popularity of blockchain technologies. However, due to the lack of easy to use tools and easy to understand theories and use cases, TKC and blockchain technologies have remained as niche areas accessible to several small circles of elite cryptographers and programmers. 

While the definitions of transient key cryptography and graph database given in the literature may be over complicated for most readers, we shall attempt to present a simplified version:

Transient key cryptography: algorithms based on asymmetric cryptography where the key pairs generated for a user, device or process (owner) change over a short period of time.

Graph database: a database whose structure is represented as a graph, by definition, made up of vertices (nodes) and edges.

- Question: Why are we using space delimited text files as database in the age of so many "proper" graph database software?

Answer: the conventional graph database software have too many outdated assumptions which may hinder Phosway.

The most important difference between graph database and conventional SQL database is often muddled by other technical issues: the key of an object, equivalent to the field or column in SQL database, can be defined on the fly. This feature makes a text file of JSON data a graph database, more flexible than any multi gigabytes SQL installation. This conclusion however may be too embarrassing for DB admins, hence perhaps intentionally subdued over the years.

We may still use them as and when needed.

:: N3

The core issue here is not whether theoretically a JSON data file is a graph database, as we could easily write a wrapper module to convert the JSON data into any format required by established graph database software. The core issue here is how to incorporate TKC into GDB ….  And train new free software programmers, and make them earn money as they learn ….


## C. Structure of Phosway

In order to present an overview of Phosway, we categorize the various modules of Phosway according to a model similar to the OSI layers, from low level to high level:

1. Phoscript Phoshell: these modules have been completed. One word at a time. Easy to teach. Helps EMYL?

- Port existing code in other Programming Languages and frameworks to Phos. This is low level work. This explains more than 50% of Phosway plan.

Helps individual project to train people, easier because of HUDAPI, incentivized by PhosPay

2. PhosKey, PhosGraph, PhosTunnel: critical components in distributed cloud, blockchain etc. Used together with PhosGraph.

How might one make use of the data in PhosGraph?


3. PhosCloud = PhosKey + PhosGraph + PhosTunnel

PhosCloud needs ssh tunnel shared vps. BitTorrent ++.


4. Phosway Applications: PhosPay PhosChat are critical for social networks PhosNet? . Forum comments, database are based on PhosGraph.

Just describe how Phosway components replicate list of MAGAF, Twitter etc. 

- Need more factors to conclude how EMYL Phosway will change FSR1 to FSR2: Just use Phosway to clone MAGAF!!


:: At end of list, need a new leading expressive paragraph.



:: N4 explaining why CLONING ... not that bad ... every section needs ONLY ONE EXPRESSIVE LEADING paragraph that reads natural to readers, to convey the contents of that section. The rest of the section are either subsections (list of paragraphs, not expressive), or expansion from the LEADING paragraph. The a complete article is made up of sections. A section is a list of expressive (leading) paragraph plus non-expressive paragraphs.

:: 1 2 3 4 are 4 different layers of OSI, from low to high.

Explain costs later. First explain relations of phos modules and how do they clone magaf. 

A to Z
- A = Start from Online tipping (EMYL Instagram Social Networks).
- Z = So main activity is clone MAGAF. 

2 aspects: 
1. final aim is to clone MAGAF. 
2. how to execute modules of Phosway in sequence?



### Stages of Development

Having understood the overall structure of Phosway, the timelines of development of various Phosway modules are decribed below:

1. User A1 adds location information F1 for Instagrammer IG1.

Any user AX can update any information FX about Instagrammer IGX.

PhosGraph becomes a collective database of personal information for any Instagrammer.

By law of slow change of popularity, a famous person will stay famous over a certain period of time. A less famous person may become more famous. As such, their personal information will become valuable.

How to use them? Need a micropayment system PhosPay to monetize information in PhosGraph, just like how MAGAF make money, but more transparent, open, small amounts.


2. User B tips IG1.

https://github.com/udexon/PhosPay

Tipping on any social network and EMYL coaching for Phosway.

:: List to do until PhosPay is usable …. This is the MOST IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE WHOLE ARTICLE!!!


3. IG1 holds meet the fans parties

PhosChat anonymous chat between fans and celebrities, very important, huge demand, captive market. Fraud from hacking dating websites.


4. Local sponsors hire IG1 to make advertisement videos.

Other talents like video editing etc. are needed.

All paid using PhosPay.




## D. Benefits of Earn Money as You Learn to Free Software Revolution 2.0

- Purpose of EMYL is to provide training

:: N5 always start with leading paragraph. Only need one leading paragraph for each section. May spawn subsection if there are more leading paragraphs?

:: Start with shortcomings of free software development without PhosPay, no directions.

So many free software programmers, no pay. A few programmers in MAGAF, highly paid. Why? How to solve?

Cloning MAGAF is not rocket science. There are enough free software programmers to do so. However, they move like random air particles. We need SEVERAL BREAKTHROUGH MECHANISMS to make these most talented individuals on Earth to become "self organized". Phosway is the name of this comprehensive suite of projects. (Click [here](https://github.com/udexon/Phosway/blob/master/README.md) for details.)

Our purpose is to educate the next generation of free software programmers, Earn Money as You Learn. Goal is to make everyone earn as much as shareholders of MAGAF, by creating a fair platform for all developers and users to participate.

Discuss here or later? Differences?

Scenarios and benefits using PhosPay.

Emphasize Phoscript one word at a time!!!

Most of the components needed for PhosPay already exist. We just need to copy them and make modifications.

Paying top 1000 free software programmers USD1000 per week only needs USD 1 million. It is small  change for millionaires around the world. Just that no platform exist for such tipping.

EMYL vs. conventional start up fundingEMYL: weekly, one programmer, free time after work, cost = tipping amount. More free man power during COVID19 crisis.Conventional start up: minimum 3 months, 5 people team, Investment?

It doesn't matter how good a programmer is. Software development is labour intensive therefore capital intensive.

PhosPay aims to overcome this bottleneck by enabling online micropayment, so that anyone can reward programmers a small amount on their contribution to free software, instead of relying on investors to invest large sums of money.

As such, the software evaluation period becomes shorter. Typical start up projects take 3 months. PhosPay free software can be evaluated weekly. Hence improved transparency and productivity.



:: N4 List Phosway A to Z.

A = EMYL Instagram tipping using PhosPay, EMYL includes Phosway PhosPay coaching.

They only need PhosPay so that their efforts can be directed, instead of Brownian random direction at the moment.

- Workplace discrimination is a cancer of the industrialized world. While some religions advocate altruism, the label of religion itself has more often than not become an excuse of discrimination.

Through examples in literature and surviving practices from pre industrialized era, we derived a training scheme known as " Earn Money as You Learn" (EMYL), which we believe will be effective in fighting workplace discrimination.

EMYL has one of its roots in the free software movement, which we recognize as having originated from Richard Stallman developing the GNU C Compiler and clones of Unix system tools.

While some proponents and opponents of the free software movement have compared it to Communism, it has contributed to and become the essential foundation of the Internet and mobile networks, driving literally one of the most if not the most important industry in the world today, serving peoples, companies and governments worldwide.

Yet as free software programmers continue to contribute selflessly to the common good of mankind, they are not fairly rewarded, as some of them get to be hired by MAGAF, while others continue to fight from the defensive end of workplace discrimination.

Some readers might be wondering what the breakthroughs are that make EMYL possible. Some may even doubt if EMYL sounds too good to be true.

Fortunately like everything else in free software, everything from concepts to code concerning EMYL are transparent, subject to scrutiny by anyone interested. 


:: Explain EMYL first, then can explain zero costs, then cloning.

Just like GNU projects' major achievements lied in cloning Unix, Phosway may create great values to society just by  cloning MAGAF social networks.

We already win, because of our zero costs and more efficient profit sharing scheme via PhosPay.

Cloning MAGAF is not rocket science. There are enough free software programmers to do so. They only need PhosPay so that their efforts can be directed, instead of Brownian random direction at the moment.

Like everything else in free software, we only need one Super Social Network!! because all free software parts will merge together!! Except programming languages and frameworks, too fragmented, essentially different ways of doing same things, which is also now merged using Phoscript/Phoshell.



:: label notes with numbers, so that can calculate how much more to correct

How to connect paragraphs above and below?

:: start of notes, end with double blank lines


## E. Investment needed for Phosway ... Search Engine or PhosKnow

:: N6

PhosEngine or PhosKnow are more complicated to grasp for users … ??

1. Otherwise, how much money is needed to build a NEW commercially sustainable search engine in 2020?

2. Merge data from everywhere, then search. Big data?

3. PhosKnow. Better Wikipedia?

Analyze the benefits of one particular aspect, e.g. PhosKnow, compared to other aspects, to give readers a comprehensive picture.


Workplace discrimination means plenty of work force for Phosway at all ages, anywhere in the world.

What can PhosGraph PhosKnow achieve?

A super social network owned by everyone and rewards everyone fairly. Has built in mechanism for fairness via competition.
