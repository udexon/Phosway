# Phosway: Networks without Barriers (NWxB)

When Sun Microsystems coined the slogan ___"the network is the computer"___, few would have foreseen a world divided into trillion dollar tech companies and free software programmers, made worse by an invisible pandemic in the year 2020 CE, partitioned by invisible barriers disguised as technologies.

To illustrate what these invisible barriers are, have a look at the following video:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPxz2n8pZu4

1. Instagram user's follwers count is extracted.
2. Phoscript commands are used to replace Instagram thumbnails on original profile page.
3. The above information and multimedia data can be shared using SSH tunnel or other public social networks, such as Twitter or GitHub itself!

Consider the following questions:

1. What do you think you can do, ___as a programmer___, to bridge the gaps between MAGA+F and free software programmers?

2. What do you think you can do, ___as a user of computers, mobile phones and websites___, to make the world 2030 more equitable where income gaps are perhaps not as bad as projected?

In the examples shown in the video, we demonstrated that Phoscript can simplify programming so that the distinctions between a programmer and a user may no longer exist. We would like to redefine the meaning of the term ___Superuser___ to represent such a combination of ___user and programmer___, as inspired by the concept of ___User___ in the legendary movie ___Tron___.

Further, by extending the use cases of SSH tunnel, we believe we are able to build a Decentralized Cloud Computing infrastructure that may rival MAGA+F.

- Phoshtron, redefine concept of Superuser.
- All notes use - bullets.

consider this almost trivial Instagram ranking web page:

1. User A opens Instagram profile of lady X, saves her username and followers count.
2. User A repeats step (1) 10 times for other Instagram users.
3. User A creates a simple web page to tabulate the results.
