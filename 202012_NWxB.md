# Phosway: Networks without Barriers (NWxB)

When Sun Microsystems coined the slogan "the network is the computer", few would foresee a world divided into trillion dollar tech companies and free software programmers, made worse by an invisible pandemic in the year 2020 CE, partitioned by invisible barriers disguised as technologies.

To illustrate what these invisible barriers are, have a look at the following video:

1. Instagram user's follwers count is extracted.
2. Phoscript commands are used to replace Instagram thumbnails on original profile page.
3. The above information and multimedia data can be shared using SSH tunnel or other public social networks, such as Twitter or GitHub itself!

consider this almost trivial Instagram ranking web page:

1. User A opens Instagram profile of lady X, saves her username and followers count.
2. User A repeats step (1) 10 times for other Instagram users.
3. User A creates a simple web page to tabulate the results.
