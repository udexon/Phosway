# Phosway: Networks without Barriers (NWxB)

When Sun Microsystems coined the slogan "the network is the computer", few would foresee a world divided into trillion dollar tech companies and free software programmers, made worse by an invisible pandemic, partitioned by invisible barriers disguised as technologies.

To illustrate what these invisible barriers are, consider this almost trivial Instagram ranking web page:

1. User A opens Instagram profile of lady X, saves her username and followers count.
2. User A repeats step (1) 10 times for other Instagram users.
3. User A creates a simple web page to tabulate the results.
