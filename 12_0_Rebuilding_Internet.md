# Rebuilding the Internet the Phosway

The Internet has come a long way and 2020 promised to bring us to new heights until the COVID19 pandemic struck.

As more and more people are forced into unemployment by the day, including programmers, it is now perhaps the best time to re-examine what could have been done better.

As usual, we take a "cutting through an onion" approach in our articles and videos &mdash; starting with a big issue, then to a core issue that is small enough for everyone to learn to do, finally revisit other big issues.

In this article and video, we shall demonstrate the core algorithms to build a Decentralized E Commerce system (DECCOM), using Phoscript, a metaprogramming script derived from the Forth programming language, which will allow anyone to sell anything, especially old items, from home, get them advertised online, delivered and monitor the payments and delivery.

This may sound like an ambitious project, because it is, but we shall also demonstrate due the unique properties of Phoscript, the code can be simplified into is something that everyone can learn to do, true to our ___Networks without Barriers___ slogan.



## Phosway

Phosway is a geeky pun derived from the Forth programming language and Amway.

1) In practical terms, Phosway allows beginners or non programmers to learn to write programs using ultra simple Forth syntax: based on Reverse Polish Notation, just a list of words, without brackets.

- Phosway allows the creation of Sandwich API, where at the highest layer, Phoscript, a metaprogramming scripting language derived from Forth, is used to call functions in a host programming language.

In the mknode example above, the host programming language is PHP.

As such, Phosway allows senior programmers to develop interface Phoscript words (function names) mapped to the host programming language, thus realizing the "last mile" in division of labour in programming projects.

Phoscript is the least cost common denominator that can be translated into any platforms or programming languages.

Programs are executed device A owned by Adam and device B owned by Brian.

Websocket etc. Communication protocols, update information.

==== 

In contrast to conventional programing languages and frameworks, what we have demonstrated are quite different but can be readily interfaced to the former.

We wish to demonstrate that, Phoscript systems can be adapted to various programming languages and platforms with minimal efforts, and is a metaprogramming script that is easy and useful to learn by beginners as well as experts.

As such, we hope that Phoscript can become a universal metaprogramming script of choice for beginners as well as experts of various fields, especially those within the computing industry.
